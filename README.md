# Convert date column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Group by month to analyze revenue trends
monthly_revenue = df.groupby(df['Date'].dt.to_period('M'))['Transaction_Amount'].sum()

# Plot the revenue trend
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
monthly_revenue.plot(kind='line', figsize=(10, 5), title='Monthly Revenue Trend')
plt.show()
```

### **Visualize Customer Segmentation**
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.boxplot(x='Product_Category', y='Transaction_Amount', data=df)
plt.title('Investment Distribution by Product Category')
